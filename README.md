## About

**CEAM (Climate and Energy Assessment for Museums)** is an open-source, data-driven tool developed by **Marcin Zygmunt** in **Climate2Preserv** research project and hosted on **GitHub** mirrored on **Google Drive** for easy access.  
It provides a comprehensive energy and climate overview for heritage buildings, helping institutions preserve cultural heritage while improving energy performance and indoor climate management.

CEAM serves as a decision-support tool for building owners, collection managers, and researchers who need to balance heritage conservation with sustainability goals. Using raw data (such as measured energy consumption and climate conditions), CEAM generates insights to improve building operations and optimize energy use.

The tool combines Python-based modules with AI-driven optimization methods to evaluate potential energy savings through short-term climate control strategies. Typical savings range from 10–50%, depending on building conditions and chosen interventions.

## Key Features

- Multi-criteria analysis of heritage preservation, indoor climate, and energy use.
- Modular Python code for easy adaptation.
- User-friendly interface (Python scripts or Windows executable).
- Example input files and manuals included.
- AI optimization to find cost-effective conservation strategies.

## How to Run

You can use CEAM in two ways:

1. **Python scripts**  
   - Run the `.py` scripts directly with **Python 3.12**.
   - Includes GUI, computation modules, and supporting scripts.
   - Check the user manual for setup and required Python packages. 

2. **Executable (Windows)**  
   - Download from: [CEAM:Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1wIT0tG_Lo9iJ8fh8vHU-SB-zgOoksMFa)
   - Run `C2P-CEAM_v1.2.1.exe` (*Run as Admin* may be needed).
   - No installation required — just prepare input and output folders as described in the manual.
