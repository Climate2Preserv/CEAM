## About

The Climate and Energy Assessment for Museums (**CEAM**) provides users with a valuable and constructive energy- and climate-related overview of heritage buildings. CEAM helps institutions preserve heritage while improving energy efficiency. The decision-support software helps building and collection owners adapt sustainable solutions using indoor climate management.

CEAM is an open-source, data-driven tool written in Python with a modular structure. It enables comprehensive multi-criteria analysis considering heritage preservation, indoor climate management, and energy efficiency improvement. The tool uses raw input data (e.g., measured energy consumption and indoor/outdoor climate conditions) to generate outputs that improve understanding of current building management and suggest ways to enhance energy performance.

The tool employs AI-based optimization methods to evaluate potential energy savings through short-term management strategies, with predicted savings ranging from 10–50% depending on the scenario and selected interventions.

## How to Run

You can use CEAM in two ways:

1. **Python scripts**  
   Run the `.py` scripts directly using Python 3.12.
   The scripts contains the main GUI script, the computing logic script, and dozens functional scripts.    
   Please refer to the user manual for setup instructions and dependencies.
   Additional packages and libraries might be required. 

2. **Executable**  
   For Windows users, a precompiled executable is available here:

   Simply download the software and run it by double-click the `C2P-CEAM_v1.2.1.exe` file to launch the application - 'Run as Admin' option might be required.  
   No installation is required — but ensure your input and output folders are prepared as described in the manual.
   Outputs generated from the provided inputs are also shared via the Google Drive.
